# Quiz Views Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed redundant quiz views and services, consolidating all functionality into the proper UGC NET Mock Test system.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Redundant Files Deleted

- ✅ `/frontend/src/views/quiz/Taking.vue` - Replaced by `/frontend/src/views/ugc-net/TestTaking.vue`
- ✅ `/frontend/src/services/quizService.js` - Redundant wrapper around ugcNetService

### 2. Router Updates
- ✅ Removed quiz component imports
- ✅ Converted quiz routes to redirects:
  - `/quiz` → `/ugc-net`
  - `/quizzes` → `/ugc-net` 
  - `/quiz/:id/take` → `/ugc-net/test/:id/take`

### 3. Service Layer Cleanup
- ✅ Removed `quizService` import from `api.js`

- ✅ Updated `UserAnalytics.vue` to use `ugcNetService.getStatistics()` instead of `quizService.getUserAnalytics()`

## What Was Updated
