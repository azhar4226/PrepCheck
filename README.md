## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Data Flow

The PrepCheck system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Client Layer**: Vue.js frontend handling user interactions and UI rendering
2. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client-server communication
3. **Service Layer**: Core business logic and AI processing pipeline
4. **Data Access Layer**: Database operations via SQLAlchemy ORM
5. **External Services**: Google Gemini AI, Redis, email services

### Database Schema

Key entities in the PrepCheck database:

- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **Subject**: UGC NET subjects (Computer Science, Mathematics, etc.)
- **Chapter**: Subject chapters and topic organization
- **Question**: Question bank with metadata, difficulty, and verification status
- **PracticeTest**: User-configured chapter-specific practice tests
- **MockTest**: Complete UGC NET simulation tests
- **TestAttempt**: User's test attempts with performance metrics
- **AIVerification**: AI verification history and confidence scores

#### Key Relationships

- User ‚Üí TestAttempt: One-to-many relationship tracking all test attempts by a user
- Subject ‚Üí Chapter: One-to-many hierarchical organization of subject material
- Chapter ‚Üí Question: One-to-many association of questions to their respective chapters
- Question ‚Üí TestAttempt: Many-to-many through attempt_questions junction table
- PracticeTest ‚Üí Chapter: Many-to-many allowing tests to cover multiple chapters
- MockTest ‚Üí Subject: Tests are organized by their relevant subject

For a complete visual representation of the database schema, refer to the entity-relationship diagrams in `docs/Reports/PREPCHECK_SYSTEM_DIAGRAMS.md`.

### Microservices

- **Web Server**: Main Flask application
- **Celery Worker**: Background task processing for AI operations
- **Redis**: Message broker and caching layer

PrepCheck leverages Google Gemini AI for:

1. **Question Generation**: Creating high-quality UGC NET questions based on subject and chapter specifications
2. **Answer Verification**: Validating user answers against expected solutions with detailed explanation
3. **Question Validation**: Ensuring generated questions meet quality standards and UGC NET format
4. **Performance Analytics**: Analyzing user performance patterns to provide personalized feedback

The AI processing flow:
