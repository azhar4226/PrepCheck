# Bug Fixes Summary - PrepCheck Project

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. LaunchDarkly Errors
**Problem:** Browser console showing `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors for LaunchDarkly URLs.
**Root Cause:** Browser ad blocker blocking external analytics/feature flag service.
**Resolution:** These are harmless external service blocks and don't affect app functionality. No code changes needed - this is expected behavior with ad blockers.

### 2. Vue Router Warning
**Problem:** `[Vue Router warn]: No match found for location with path "/notifications"`
**Root Cause:** Missing route definition for notifications page.
**Resolution:** 
- Added notifications route to `/frontend/src/router/index.js`
- Created new Notifications view component at `/frontend/src/views/user/Notifications.vue`
- Route now properly handles `/notifications` path

### 3. CORS/API Error in SubjectManagement
**Problem:** 
- `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/admin/subjects' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy`
- `SubjectManagement.vue` using incorrect API method

**Root Cause:** 
- CORS configuration only allowed port 3000, but frontend was running on 3001
- Component was calling `apiService.get('/admin/subjects')` but no generic `get` method exists

**Resolution:**
- Updated CORS configuration in `/backend/app/__init__.py` to allow both ports 3000 and 3001
- Fixed SubjectManagement.vue to use correct API method: `apiService.getSubjects()` instead of `apiService.get('/admin/subjects')`

### 4. API Method Inconsistency
**Problem:** Frontend components calling non-existent generic API methods.
**Root Cause:** Missing or incorrect API service method calls.
**Resolution:** Ensured all components use the specific API methods defined in `api.js`:
- `getSubjects()` for subjects
- `getNotifications()` for notifications
- `markNotificationAsRead()` and `markAllNotificationsAsRead()` for notification management

## Files Modified:

### Backend:
- `/backend/app/__init__.py` - Updated CORS configuration to allow ports 3000 and 3001

### Frontend:
- `/frontend/src/router/index.js` - Added notifications route
- `/frontend/src/views/admin/SubjectManagement.vue` - Fixed API method call
- `/frontend/src/views/user/Notifications.vue` - Created new notifications page component

### Test Files:
- `/test-subject-management.html` - Created test file to verify CORS and API fixes

## Verification:
1. ✅ Backend API endpoints working correctly (tested with curl)
2. ✅ CORS configuration allows both frontend ports
3. ✅ SubjectManagement page loads subjects without errors
4. ✅ Notifications route resolves correctly
5. ✅ All API service methods properly defined and used

## Current Status:
All critical frontend-backend integration issues have been resolved. The application should now function without CORS errors, router warnings, or API method failures.

**Note:** LaunchDarkly errors are external service blocks by ad blockers and do not impact core application functionality.
