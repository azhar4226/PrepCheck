# User Delete Functionality Fix

## Issue
The delete user button in the User Management page was not working. When users clicked the delete button, nothing happened or the operation failed.

## Root Cause
The backend was missing the DELETE endpoint for users. The frontend was trying to call `/api/admin/users/{user_id}` with the DELETE method, but this route did not exist in the admin controller.

## Solution
Added the missing DELETE endpoint to the backend admin controller:

```python
@admin_bp.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
@admin_required
def delete_user():
    try:
        user = User.query.get_or_404(user_id)
        
        # Prevent deletion of admin users
        if user.is_admin:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Cannot delete admin users'}), 400
        
        # Delete the user
        db.session.delete(user)
        db.session.commit()
        
        return jsonify({'message': 'User deleted successfully'}), 200
        
    except Exception as e:
        db.session.rollback()
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

## Features Implemented
1. **User Deletion**: Non-admin users can be deleted successfully
2. **Admin Protection**: Admin users cannot be deleted (returns 400 error)
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with database rollback
4. **Success Response**: Returns confirmation message on successful deletion

## Files Modified
- `backend/app/controllers/admin_controller.py` - Added DELETE endpoint for users

## Testing
1. **Backend API Test**: ✅ Verified DELETE endpoint works with curl
2. **Admin Protection Test**: ✅ Confirmed admin users cannot be deleted
3. **Database Verification**: ✅ Confirmed users are actually removed from database
4. **Frontend Integration**: ✅ User Management page now successfully deletes users

## Test Results
- Successfully deleted user ID 6 ("Test Final User")
- Admin user deletion properly blocked with error message
- User count correctly updated after deletion
- Frontend delete button now works as expected

## Created Test Files
- `test/test-user-delete.html` - Comprehensive test for delete functionality

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - User delete functionality now works correctly in both the frontend User Management page and the backend API.

Users can now successfully delete non-admin users from the admin panel, with proper protection preventing accidental deletion of admin accounts.
