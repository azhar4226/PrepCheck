## Backend Changes

### Models Updated:
- ✅ `models.py`: Updated User model notification field

### Controllers Updated:
- ✅ `question_bank_controller.py`: 
  - Renamed endpoint from `/questions/for-quiz` to `/questions/for-practice`
  - Updated method name from `get_questions_for_quiz` to `get_questions_for_practice`
- ✅ `admin_controller.py`:

## Frontend Changes

### Vue Components Updated:
- ✅ `AIQuestionGenerator.vue` (renamed from AIQuizGenerator.vue):
  - Updated all quiz references to questions
  - Changed generatedQuiz to generatedQuestions
  - Updated verification methods
  - Updated component name
- ✅ `QuestionManagement.vue`:
  - Updated Quiz references to Test
  - Changed quizzes to tests
  - Updated filter references from quiz_id to test_id
  - Updated API calls
- ✅ `MockTestResults.vue` (renamed from QuizResults.vue):
  - Updated component for admin test results management
  - Maintained separation from student TestResults.vue
- ✅ `Dashboard.vue`: Updated quiz_title fallback to mock_test_title
- ✅ `QuestionBankManagement.vue`: Updated description text
- ✅ `SubjectManagement.vue`: Changed quizzes_count to questions_count
- ✅ `UnifiedDashboard.vue`: Updated dashboard includes and CSS classes

### File Structure:
- ✅ Kept both TestResults.vue files with clear separation:
  - `/ugc-net/TestResults.vue` - Student individual results view
  - `/admin/MockTestResults.vue` - Admin management dashboard

## API Endpoints Updated:
- ✅ `/api/question-bank/questions/for-practice` (was for-quiz)
- ✅ `/admin/export/test-results` (was quiz-results)
- ✅ Mock test endpoints using correct terminology

## Database Migration:
- ✅ Created migration for notification field rename
- ✅ Database already clean of quiz tables

## Testing:
- ✅ Frontend build passes successfully
- ✅ No syntax errors in updated files
- ✅ Router configuration updated

## Current State:
✅ **COMPLETE**: All quiz references have been successfully removed from the codebase and replaced with question bank model terminology. The system now uses:
- **Question Bank** for storing reusable questions
- **Mock Tests** for UGC NET test creation
- **Practice Tests** for chapter-wise practice
- **Test Results** for all result management

## Final Cleanup Phase:
✅ **Removed Unused Controller Files:**
- `admin_controller_new.py` - Unused duplicate removed
- `analytics_controller_new.py` - Unused duplicate removed
- `user_controller_new.py` - Unused duplicate removed

✅ **Updated AI Service:**
- Renamed `generate_quiz()` → `generate_test_questions()`
- Renamed `_generate_mock_quiz()` → `_generate_mock_test_questions()`
- Renamed `_generate_real_quiz()` → `_generate_real_test_questions()`
- Renamed `_validate_quiz_data()` → `_validate_test_data()`
- Updated all internal variables and references

✅ **Updated Frontend Dashboard:**
- Fixed `useDashboard.js` to use `userRecentTests` instead of `userRecentQuizzes`
- Updated all related variables and activity references

✅ **Final Verification:**
- Backend imports successfully
- Frontend builds without errors
- All quiz references removed from codebase
- Only new models and endpoints remain in use

The codebase is now completely migrated to the question bank model with no quiz references remaining.
