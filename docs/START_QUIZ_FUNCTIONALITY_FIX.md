# Start Quiz Button Functionality Fix

## Issue
The "Start Quiz" button on the browse quiz page was not working. Clicking the button did not start the quiz or navigate to the quiz taking interface.

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect API Integration**: The QuizTaking component was using the old `api` service instead of the authenticated `api` instance from `useAuth`.
2. **Missing API Prefix**: API endpoints were missing the `/api` prefix required by the backend routes.
3. **Response Handling**: The component was not correctly handling the backend response structure.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed API Integration
Updated `frontend/src/views/quiz/Taking.vue`:

**Before:**
```javascript
import api from '@/services/api'
// ...
const response = await api.post(`/quiz/${route.params.id}/start`)
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '@/composables/useAuth'
// ...
const { api } = useAuth()
// ...
const response = await api.post(`/api/quiz/${route.params.id}/start`)
```

### 2. Updated All API Endpoints
Fixed all quiz-related API calls in the QuizTaking component:
- `startQuiz()` - now uses `/api/quiz/{id}/start`
- `submitQuiz()` - now uses `/api/quiz/{id}/submit`
- `saveProgress()` - now uses `/api/quiz/{id}/save`

### 3. Fixed Response Handling
Updated the quiz start function to correctly handle the backend response structure:

```javascript
const response = await api.post(`/api/quiz/${route.params.id}/start`)
quiz.value = response.data.quiz
quiz.value.questions = response.data.questions
timeRemaining.value = response.data.time_remaining
```

## Backend Verification
Confirmed that all required backend endpoints are working correctly:
- ✅ `/api/quiz/{id}/start` - Starts a new quiz attempt
- ✅ `/api/quiz/{id}/submit` - Submits quiz answers
- ✅ `/api/quiz/{id}/save` - Saves quiz progress

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/views/quiz/Taking.vue` - Fixed authentication and API calls

## Testing Results
- ✅ Quiz start API endpoint working correctly
- ✅ Quiz data loading properly (questions, time limit, metadata)
- ✅ Navigation from browse page to quiz taking page functional
- ✅ Authentication integration working
- ✅ Full user journey (browse → start → take quiz) operational

## User Journey Flow
1. **Browse Quizzes**: User visits `/quizzes` and sees available quizzes
2. **Start Quiz**: User clicks "Start Quiz" button on any quiz
3. **Navigate**: Router navigates to `/quiz/{id}/take`
4. **Load Quiz**: QuizTaking component loads quiz data via API
5. **Display Interface**: Quiz questions and timer interface displayed
6. **Take Quiz**: User can answer questions and submit

## Created Test Files
- `test/test-start-quiz-functionality.html` - Comprehensive test suite

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The "Start Quiz" button now works correctly. Users can successfully start quizzes from the browse page and proceed to the quiz taking interface with proper authentication and data loading.

The complete quiz taking workflow is now functional, including:
- Quiz browsing and selection
- Quiz starting and data loading
- Question navigation and answering
- Progress saving and quiz submission
