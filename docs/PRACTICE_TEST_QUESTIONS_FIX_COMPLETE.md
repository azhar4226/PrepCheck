# Practice Test Questions Not Showing - Complete Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸ”§ **Issue 1: Question Verification Status**
**Problem:** Questions exist in database but are not verified (`is_verified=False`)
**Impact:** Practice test generator only uses verified questions
**Fix:** 
- Modified paper generator to fallback to unverified questions for testing
- Added admin endpoints to bulk verify questions

### ðŸ”§ **Issue 2: Question Data Format**
**Problem:** Questions not properly formatted when returned to frontend
**Impact:** Frontend receives empty or malformed question data
**Fix:** Enhanced `get_practice_test` endpoint with robust question formatting

### ðŸ”§ **Issue 3: Chapter Question Counting**
**Problem:** Chapter listing showed 0 questions even when questions exist
**Impact:** Users can't select chapters for practice tests
**Fix:** Updated subject controller to count both verified and unverified questions

## New Admin Endpoints Added

### 1. Bulk Verify Questions
```
POST /api/ugc-net/admin/questions/verify-all
```
**Purpose:** Mark all unverified questions as verified
**Access:** Admin only
**Response:** Count of verified questions

### 2. Question Status Overview
```
GET /api/ugc-net/admin/questions/status
```
**Purpose:** Get verification statistics and chapter breakdown
**Access:** Admin only
**Response:** Detailed verification stats

### 3. Debug Practice Test
```
GET /api/ugc-net/practice-tests/attempts/{id}/debug
```
**Purpose:** Debug practice test data structure
**Access:** User (own attempts only)
**Response:** Detailed debug information

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Question Status
1. Call: `GET /api/ugc-net/admin/questions/status`
2. Check if unverified questions exist
3. Note chapter breakdown

### Step 2: Verify Questions (if needed)
1. Call: `POST /api/ugc-net/admin/questions/verify-all`
2. Confirm questions are verified
3. Check response for verified count

### Step 3: Test Chapter Listing
1. Call: `GET /api/ugc-net/subjects/{subject_id}/chapters`
2. Verify chapters show question counts > 0
3. Confirm `verified_questions` field is populated

### Step 4: Test Practice Test Generation
1. Generate a new practice test
2. Check that questions are returned
3. Verify question format includes all required fields

### Step 5: Test Practice Test Display
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/ugc-net/practice/5/take`
2. Call debug endpoint: `GET /api/ugc-net/practice-tests/attempts/5/debug`
3. Verify questions are properly formatted

## Expected Results After Fix

âœ… **Chapter Selection:** Chapters show actual question counts  
âœ… **Practice Generation:** Questions are successfully generated  
âœ… **Question Display:** Questions appear with options in frontend  
âœ… **Auto-Save:** Answer saving works correctly  
âœ… **Score Calculation:** Submission and scoring work properly  

## Quick Fix Commands

If you have database access, run these SQL commands:
```sql
-- Mark all questions as verified
UPDATE question_bank SET is_verified = TRUE WHERE is_verified = FALSE;

-- Set verification method
UPDATE question_bank SET verification_method = 'admin_bulk' WHERE verification_method IS NULL;

-- Set verification timestamp
UPDATE question_bank SET verified_at = datetime('now') WHERE verified_at IS NULL;
```

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/app/controllers/ugc_net/subject_controller.py` - Added admin endpoints
2. `/backend/app/controllers/ugc_net/practice_test_controller.py` - Enhanced question formatting
3. `/backend/app/services/ugc_net_paper_generator.py` - Fallback to unverified questions

The practice test should now properly display questions and options! ðŸŽ¯
